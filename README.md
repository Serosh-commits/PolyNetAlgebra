**Forge the future of networked systems with C++!**  
PolyNetAlgebra is a math-driven C++ playground for mastering networked systems through hands-on projects in AI, quant finance, cybersecurity, systems programming, and quantum computing. From scheduling algorithms to quantum protocols, every commit hones your skills and builds a universe of code. Join the multiverseâ€”code, learn, contribute!

## ðŸŒŒ About
PolyNetAlgebra is your hub for building and practicing advanced C++ projects that fuse networks with algebraic precision. Whether you're optimizing AI task queues, simulating high-frequency trading schedules, securing cyber protocols, crafting kernel-level networking, or exploring quantum gate scheduling, this repo is where theory meets code. Expect math-heavy solutions (queueing theory, group theory, linear algebra) and cryptic, fun challenges that push your polymath limits.

**Why PolyNetAlgebra?**
- **Cross-Domain Mastery**: Tackle AI (ML pipelines), quant (HFT scheduling), cyber (secure FSMs), systems (kernel networking), and quantum (Clifford algebras).
- **Math-Driven**: Leverage queueing theory, Lie groups, and Eigen for real-world impact.
- **Hands-On**: Every concept (enums, scheduling metrics, inheritance) is coded, tested, and pushed here.
- **Resume Rocket**: Build a portfolio to wow internship recruiters (Google, Citadel, IBM Quantum).
- **Open-Source**: Join a community forging the future of networked systems.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repo**:
